# Firmware for the t-watch 2020
This repository contain a port of the 'factory firmware' for the t-watch 2020 to MicroPython. 

The 'factory firmware' is provided by Dirk Bro√üwick and can be found on https://github.com/sharandac/My-TTGO-Watch
It is written in C++ for the Arduino framework and is developed under platform io. At first I will try to simply translate the C++ program to MicrPython and later adapt the applications to my personal requirement.
The software in this repository is work in progress and it may not work at all.
In addition to the firmware a setup script is provided downloading all the necessary code and image files to the t-watch
